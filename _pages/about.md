Hello, my dear friend. Welcome to my homepage.

I am currently a researcher of [the Institute of Innovation for Future Socity (InFuS)](https://www.mirai.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) and [Nagoya Univ., Center for Embedded Computing Systems (NCES)](https://www.nces.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) at Nagoya university.  

I received my B.S. and M.E. degrees in *geographic information system* and *navigation, guidance, and control* from ***Wuhan University***, in 2014 and 2017 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in *informatics* from ***Nagoya University*** in 2023.

My research interests include, but are not limited to:
- Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV)
- High-Defination (HD) map
- Dynamic Map (DM) 
- Vehicle Motion Prediction
- Sensor Fusion
- Edge and Cloud Computing

The following figure illustrates my current and future vision for R&D.
