**Abstract**: The lane-level map, which contains the lane-level information severely lacking in widely used commercial navigation maps, has become an essential data source for autonomous driving systems. The linking relations between lane-level map and commercial navigation map can facilitate an autonomous driving system mapping information between different applications using different maps. In this paper, an approach is proposed to build the linking relations automatically. The different topology networks are first reconstructed into similar structures. Then, to build the linking relations automatically, the adaptive multi-filter algorithm and forward path exploring algorithm are proposed to detect corresponding junctions and paths, respectively. The approach is validated by two real data sets of more than 150 km of roads, mainly highway. The linking relations for nearly 94% of the total road length have been built successfully.
